# üå†üå† Magic Transporters By Mohammad Bali

Welcome to **Magic Transporters** - a streamlined, magical way to handle item logistics. This application provides a robust and RESTful API for managing *Magic Workers*, who perform item transportation missions with the power of virtual magic. With a well-structured TypeScript/Express backend, MongoDB integration, and comprehensive documentation, Magic Transporters ensures reliable handling of transportation tasks with a touch of enchantment.

## üöÄ Features

1. **Add and Manage Magic Workers** - Create and manage the "workers" responsible for item transport missions.
2. **Add and Manage Magic Items** - Register items, each with a defined weight, to be moved by Magic Workers.
3. **Mission Management**:
    - **Loading** - Load items onto a Magic Mover, updating their state to "loading".
    - **On-Mission** - Start a mission, locking the mover into the "on-mission" state and preventing additional loading.
    - **Mission Completion** - Complete a mission, resetting the mover‚Äôs state to "resting" and clearing all loaded items.
4. **Leaderboard** - View a list of the Magic Workers who have completed the most missions.
5. **Authentication** - Authentication middleware secures mission and item management.
6. **Swagger Documentation** - Live documentation with Swagger UI.

> *Bonus: This project includes several advanced features that go beyond the requirements, including Swagger documentation, authentication & data population for a better experience.*
